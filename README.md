Recov is a Mobile based product procurement solution, focused on streamlining the uploading, ordering and delivery of important products (PPE) to organisations in Australia

Designed to primarily address a significant issue facing organisations (Emergency Services, NGOs) caused due to the covid-19 pandemic: 

Lack of an adequate and reliable supply acquisition infrastructure for PPE, especially during emergency situations including natural disaster

TO RUN:

Application works optimally with Android studio, with most recent pixel type emulator. 

Note: database functionality might require clearing emulator cache and running a fresh version of emulator

Database is situated on firebase, utilizes Australia Post API
